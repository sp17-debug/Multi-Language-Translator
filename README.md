Multi-language Translator Application
Description:
This application is a simple multilingual translator that leverages the NLLB-200 Distilled 600M model by Facebook for translating English text into various languages. The application is built using PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and Gradio for the user interface. It allows users to input English text and translate it into German, French, Hindi, and Romanian.

Features:
English to Multilingual Translation: Translate English text into German, French, Hindi, and Romanian.
Easy-to-use Interface: Input text and select the target language using Gradio's intuitive web interface.
High-performance Translation: Powered by the NLLB-200 Distilled 600M model for quality translation results.
Language Code Support: Translations are based on the FLORES-200 language code standard.
Prerequisites:
Python 3.8+
PyTorch
Hugging Face Transformers
Gradio
JSON file with language-to-FLORES mappings
Installation:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch transformers gradio
Download the Model: You can download the NLLB-200 Distilled 600M model and place it in the path specified by model_path in the code, or it will download automatically when you run the application for the first time.

Prepare the language.json file: Ensure that the language.json file contains the following structure:

json
Copy code
[
   {
      "Language": "German",
      "FLORES-200 code": "deu_Latn"
   },
   {
      "Language": "French",
      "FLORES-200 code": "fra_Latn"
   },
   {
      "Language": "Hindi",
      "FLORES-200 code": "hin_Deva"
   },
   {
      "Language": "Romanian",
      "FLORES-200 code": "ron_Latn"
   }
]
How to Run:
Execute the application: Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open the Interface: The Gradio interface will automatically open in your default web browser. You will be able to input text, select the language for translation, and view the translated output.

Usage:
Input text: Enter the text you want to translate (in English).
Select language: Choose the target language from the dropdown (German, French, Hindi, Romanian).
Get translation: The translated text will be displayed in the output box.
Example:
Input:

Text: "Good morning, how are you?"
Language: "German"
Output:

Translated Text: "Guten Morgen, wie geht es dir?"

Future Improvements:
Add support for more languages.
Improve the UI by adding features like selecting the source language or detecting the language.
Implement optimizations for faster translation.
